# Edward Lee's Portfolio
# Autonomous Planar One Legged Robot
This folder contains the critical design report and control codes used for MAE 106. My primary role as a control engineer was allowing the robot to steer and drive semi-autonomously by incorporating a closed-loop feedback control mechanism by achieving and maintaining desired output condition.
# Base 11 Space Challenge
In 2017, Base 11 became a partner of the UCI Rocket Project. Their gracious donation enabled the construction of our rocket lab. Our Preliminary Test Rocket (PTR) is designed to break the current altitude record of 13,000 ft for university-built liquid rockets. Propelled by our PTE engine, its lightweight aluminum/ carbon fiber body will soar to an estimated 30,000 feet and be safely recovered on the ground using a two-stage parachute system. As a safety officer in 18-19, I specialized in documenting and proctoring all test procedures, conducting FMEA, and performing safety training to UCI Rocket Project engineers. 
# CAD Project
This folder contains a presentation and SLDPT for a MAE 52 project where I utilized SolidWorks to design and run FEA on a Klingon starship mock-up.
# Friends of Amateur Rocketry - DPF Challenge
This folder contains the reports and Static Test Fire simulations for PTR during my role as a structures engineer in the Launch Vehicle sub-team. During the Fall quarter of 2019, the team has scheduled and completed a successful static test fire to experimentally verify our first engine design. My primary role was creating a vertical assembly of the rocket and designing LOX, LNG, and He tank mounts. 
# Python Projects
This folder contains side projects that I created to accelerate my learning in Python.
# UCLA Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory
This folder contains my work as a participant in a summer research program. There, I presented on my research at the end of the program and participated in the poster symposium where my partner and I won the best presentation award.
